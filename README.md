# ecommerce-website-flask
A webshop built with python Flask using stripe checkout for online payments

This is just a test page for development, i stored images locally, it's not simple to add new images

Using the form you can add new products, but the category must have exactly the same, and the name must be exactly the same without the underscore

You can register to the page, and you can make online payments with stripe checkout.

Using the sqlalchemy, the program manages the users, the products and the orders

Automatically send email about the order summary after checkout

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project i tryed to include all characteristics of a real ecommerce website.

If you want to use the online payment, and the email sending functions, you must

have to give your own email smtp address, email password, and stripe api key for online payments.
